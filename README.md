This is a final project for a Linear Regression course that I completed during my sophomore year at Pomona College. 
I analyzed play-by-play data from the 2013-2016 NFL seasons for my hometown team, the Seattle Seahawks. 
The report includes applications of several popular regression techniques including LASSO, Regression Splines, and LOESS.
